When working with objects in JavaScript, it is common to need to set default values for empty `strings`/`objects`/`arrays`, `null`, or `undefined` properties. When dealing with nested objects, this can become even more complicated and require complex programming logic. However, with the "**[default-composer](https://github.com/aralroca/default-composer)**" library, this task becomes simple and easy.

## What is "default-composer"?


"[default-composer](https://github.com/aralroca/default-composer)" is a lightweight (~300B) JavaScript library that allows you to set default values for nested objects. The library replaces empty strings/arrays/objects, null, or undefined values in an existing object with the defined default values, which helps simplify programming logic and reduce the amount of code needed to set default values.

## Benefits over Spread Operator and Object.assign

While [`...spread` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) and [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) can also be used to set default values for objects, "**[`default-composer`](https://github.com/aralroca/default-composer)**" provides several benefits over these methods.

* Works with **nested objects**, whereas the spread operator and `Object.assign()` only work with shallow objects.
* More concise and **easier to read** than spread operator or `Object.assign()`. The code required to set default values with these methods can become very verbose and difficult to read, especially when dealing with nested objects.
* More granular **control** over which **properties** should be **set to default values**. With spread operator and `Object.assign()`.

Imagine we have this original object:

```js
const original = {
  name: "",
  score: null,
  address: {
    street: "",
    city: "",
    state: "",
    zip: "",
  },
  emails: [],
  hobbies: [],
  another: "anotherValue"
};
```

And these are the defaults:

```js
const defaults = {
  name: "John Doe",
  score: 5,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "12345",
  },
  emails: ["john.doe@example.com"],
  hobbies: ["reading", "traveling"],
};
```

We want to merge these objects replacing the original values that are `""`, `null`, `[]`, `undefined` and `{}` to the default value. So the idea is to get:

```js
console.log(results)
/**
 * {
 * "name": "John Doe",
 * "score": 5,
 * "address": {
 *   "street": "123 Main St",
 *   "city": "Anytown",
 *   "state": "CA",
 *   "zip": "12345"
 * },
 * "emails": [
 *   "john.doe@example.com"
 * ],
 * "hobbies": [
 *   "reading",
 *   "traveling"
 * ],
 * "another": "anotherValue"
 **/
```

Probably with spread operator we will have to do something like that:

```js
const results = {
  ...defaults,
  ...original,
  name: original.name || defaults.name,
  score: original.score ?? defaults.score, // "??" beacause 0 is valid
  address: {
    ...defaults.address,
    ...original.address,
    street: original.address.street ||Â defaults.address.street,
    city: original.address.city ||Â defaults.address.city,
    state: original.address.state ||Â defaults.address.state,
    zip: original.address.zip ||Â defaults.address.zip,
  },
  emails: original.emails.length ? original.emails : defaults.emails,
  hobbies: original.hobbies.length ? original.hobbies : defaults.hobbies,
};
```

and with `Object.assign` something like this:

```js
const results = Object.assign({}, defaults, original, {
  name: original.name || defaults.name,
  score: original.score ?? defaults.score, // "??" beacause 0 is valid
  address: Object.assign({}, defaults.address, original.address, {
    street: original.address.street || defaults.address.street,
    city: original.address.city || defaults.address.city,
    state: original.address.state || defaults.address.state,
    zip: original.address.zip || defaults.address.zip,
  }),
  emails: original.emails.length ? original.emails : defaults.emails,
  hobbies: original.hobbies.length ? original.hobbies : defaults.hobbies,
});
```

Maintaining this can be very tidious, especially with huge, heavily nested objects.

With `defaultComposer` we could only use this:

```js
import defaultComposer from 'default-composer'; // 300B
// ...
const results = defaultComposer(defaults, original);
```

Easier to maintain, right? ðŸ˜‰

What happens if in our project there is a special property that works differently from the others and we want another replacement logic? Well, although `defaultComposer` has by default a configuration to detect the defautable values, you can configure it as you like.

```ts
import { defaultComposer, setConfig } from 'default-composer';

setConfig({
  // This function is executed for each value of each key that exists in 
  // both the original object and the defaults object.
  isDefaultableValue: (
    // - key: key of original or default object
    // - value: value in the original object
    // - defaultableValue: pre-calculed boolean, you can use or not, 
    //   depending if all the rules of the default-composer library are correct
    //   for your project or you need a totally different ones.
    { key, value, defaultableValue }
    ) => {
    if (key === 'rare-key') {
      return defaultableValue ||Â value === 'EMPTY'
    } 

    return defaultableValue;
  },
});
```

## Conclusions

I've introduced the "[default-composer](https://github.com/aralroca/default-composer)" library as a solution for setting **default values** for **nested objects** in JavaScript. 

The library is lightweight and provides more concise and easier-to-read code than the spread operator and `Object.assign` methods. It also offers more granular control over which properties should be set to default values. 

In this article I provide examples of how to use the library and how it simplifies the code for maintaining nested objects. 

Finally, I explain how the library **can be configured** to handle **special cases** where a different replacement logic is required. Overall, "[default-composer](https://github.com/aralroca/default-composer)" is a useful library for simplifying the task of setting default values for nested objects in JavaScript.
