## What is WebAssembly?

In all current browsers there is a JavaScript engine that interprets and executes the code. This has allowed us to implement very rich web applications because JavaScript is getting better and more complete everyday. However, it's a high-level language but still not ideal for some tasks because it has **not been developed to be a fast language** with a lot of performance.

WebAssembly (**WASM**) is a new portable **binary-code format** that can be executed in modern browsers. It is complemented with a **text format** (**WAT**) to make it more **readable/debuggable** for us, in addition to allow us to code directly in a kind of "assembly" code. It's an open [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/) still in progress that allows us to write **fast and efficient** code for the web in other languages than JavaScript and it runs with a **similar performance to the native language**. It's not here to replace JavaScript, but to complement it.

Another purpose of WebAssembly is to keep the web **secure**, light and fast, keeping a **small** `.wasm` **file size** and always maintaining **backwards-compatibility** in new WASM features, so the web doesn't break.

There are more than [40 supported languages](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs) for WebAssembly, the most common are C, C++ and Rust for their performance and maturity, although you also can write code for WASM with high-level languages as Python, PHP or even JavaScript!

Some **practical uses** of WebAssembly:

- Encryption
- Games that require a lot of assets
- Image and video editing
- P2P
- High-performance algorithms
- VR, AR
- Visualizations and simulations
- A big etc...

## Why in Rust?

Perhaps you wonder why choose [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), when we have so many languages available with WebAssembly. There are several reasons for that:

- **Performance**: Rust is free from the non-deterministic garbage collection and it gives to programmers the control over indirection, monomorphization, and memory layout.
- **Small `.wasm` sizes**: Rust lacks a runtime, enabling small `.wasm` size because there is no extra bloat included like a garbage collector. Hence you only pay in code size, for these functions that you're using.
- **Integration**: Rust and Webassembly integrates with existing JavaScript tooling (npm, Webpack...).

## Execute Rust code from JavaScript

Assuming you have both [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for JS) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (for Rust), another prerequisite we need to install it is [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack):

```
> cargo install wasm-pack
```

### Rust code

Let's create a new Rust project for the "Hello world":

```
> cargo new helloworld --lib
```

On `Cargo.toml` we are going to add the next:

```toml
[package]
name = "helloworld"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Aral Roca Gomez <contact@aralroca.com>"]
edition = "2018"

##Â new things...
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.67"

[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]
wasm-opt = ["-Oz", "--enable-mutable-globals"]
```

- `cdylib` lib for `wasm` final artifacts.
- [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) dependency to facilitate high-level interactions between Wasm modules and JavaScript.

> **Note**: The latest part about `--enable-mutable-globals` in principle, in upcoming `wasm-bindgen` releases, should not be needed but for this tutorial it's necessary. Otherwise [we can not work with Strings](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/886#issuecomment-667669802).

WebAssembly only supports the i32, u32, i64 and u64 types. If you want to work with other types, such as String or Objects, you normally must first encode them. However, **wasm-bindgen** does these bindings for us. There's no need to worry about it anymore. That said, let's create our `helloworld` function to return a String in `src/lib.rs`:

```rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn helloworld() -> String {
    String::from("Hello world from Rust!")
}
```

### Compilation

Let's compile Rust's code with:

```
> wasm-pack build --target web
```

We are using the web target, however there are different targets we can use depending on how we want to use that `wasm` file:

- **--target bundler** - for bundlers like Webpack, Parcel or Rollup.
- **--target web** - for the web as ECMAScript module.
- **--target no-modules** - for the web without ECMAScript module.
- **--target nodejs** - for Node.js

After executing the above command, a `pkg` directory will have been created with our JavaScript library containing the code we have made in Rust! It even generates the types files of TypeScript.

```bh
> ls -l pkg
total 72
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    929 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.d.ts
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff   3210 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.js
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    313 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    268 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld_bg.d.ts
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff  15160 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld_bg.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    289 Aug 15 13:38 package.json
```

Now it's ready as a JavaScript package so we can use it in our project or even upload the package to NPM as we can see later.

The `.js` file contains the necessary "glue" code to not have to worry about working outside the `pkg` with buffers, text decoders, etc.

### Use the compiled code on our JS project

In order to use the `wasm` file in our JavaScript, we can import the generated `pkg` module to our project. To test it, we can create an `index.html` on the root of the Rust project with this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>"Hello world" in Rust + Webassembly</title>
    <script type="module">
      import init, { helloworld } from './pkg/helloworld.js'

      async function run() {
        await init()
        document.body.textContent = helloworld()
      }

      run()
    </script>
  </head>

  <body></body>
</html>
```

As you can see, before using the `helloworld` function it's important to call the asyncronous `init` function in order to load the `wasm` file. Then, we can use the public Rust functions more easily!

To test it, you can do `npx serve .` and open `http://localhost:5000`.

  <figcaption><small>Result of hello world in Rust and WASM</small></figcaption>
</figure>

## Execute JavaScript code from Rust

It is possible to use JavaScript code within Rust, for example to use `window` variables, write in the DOM or call internal functions such as `console.log`. All we have to do is to declare the JavaScript bindings we want to use inside `extern "C"`.

As an example we are going to use the function `console.log` inside Rust:

```rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
    fn log(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn example() {
    log("Log from rust");
}
```

As we can see, inside the `extern "C"` we have to indicate the `js_namespace` (console) declaring the function that we'll use inside the namespace (log). In this case we've put only one string as a parameter but if we wanted to execute a `console.log` with multiple parameters they would have to be declared.

And in our JS:

```js
import init, { example } from './pkg/helloworld.js'

async function run() {
  await init()
  example() // This will log "Log from rust" to the console
}

run()
```

## Performance - JavaScript vs Rust

Let's do a comparison of a slightly more expensive function, such as the [fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) function, to see how it performs in both Rust and JavaScript:

```rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 | 1 => n,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}
```

Using the `console.time` function we can measure the performance of each one:

```js
import init, { fibonacci } from './pkg/helloworld.js'

function fibonacciInJs(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n
  return fibonacciInJs(n - 1) + fibonacciInJs(n - 2)
}

async function run() {
  await init()
  const num = 20

  console.time('Fibonnaci in rust')
  const fibRust = fibonacci(num)
  console.timeEnd('Fibonnaci in rust')

  console.time('Fibonnaci in JS')
  const fibJS = fibonacciInJs(num)
  console.timeEnd('Fibonnaci in JS')

  document.body.textContent = `Fib ${num}:  Rust ${fibRust} - JS ${fibJS}`
}

run()
```

And the result:

<figure align="center">
  <img src="/images/blog-images/fibonacci-rust-vs-js.png" alt="Performance of fibonnaci function Rust vs JavaScript" class="center" />
  <figcaption><small>Performance of fibonnaci function Rust vs JavaScript</small></figcaption>
</figure>

- In Rust: 0.13ms
- In JS: 1.28ms

Around **x10 times faster** in Rust than in JS!

However, it's important to note that not all functions we implement in Rust will be faster than in JavaScript. But there will be a considerable improvement in many of them that require recursion or loops.

## Debugging

If in `devtools -> source` we look inside our files for our `.wasm` file, we'll see that instead of binary it shows us the WAT file being more readable and debuggable.

<figure align="center">
  <img src="/images/blog-images/debug-wasm.jpg" alt="Debug WASM in Chrome dev tools" class="center" />
  <figcaption><small>Debug WASM in Chrome dev tools</small></figcaption>
</figure>

For a better debugging experience, you can use the `--debug` flag to display the names of the functions you have used in Rust.

```
> wasm-pack build --target web --debug
```

For now, with `wasm-bindgen` it's not possible to use source-maps to display the code in Rust on devtools. But I suppose in the future it will be available.

## Publishing to NPM

Once we have our pkg directory generated, we can package it with:

```
>  wasm-pack pack myproject/pkg
```

And publish it at npm with:

```
> wasm-pack publish
```

They work the same way as with `npm pack` and `npm publish`, so we could use the same flags as `wasm-pack publish --tag next`.

## Conclusions

In this article we've seen a bit of what WebAssembly is and what is necessary to start creating web applications with Rust.

We have used Rust because is one of the best integrated but it's possible to use many other languages. This way, we can bring back to life old applications made with languages like C, C++ , and implement more futuristic and portable applications for VR or AR. All this thanks to the browser!
